# Physical Informed Neural Network for a driven-damped NLSE
## Background
In the realm of nonlinear optics, the study of light-matter interactions in optical cavities has garnered significant interest due to its applications in various fields such as telecommunications, spectroscopy, and quantum computing. One of the fundamental equations describing the dynamics of the optical field in such systems is the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE). The Lugiato-Lefever Equation (LLE), a specific form of the driven-damped NLSE, models the behavior of light in a Kerr medium within an optical cavity, considering both dispersion and nonlinearity.

The LLE is pivotal for understanding phenomena like optical frequency comb generation, temporal cavity solitons, and pattern formation in nonlinear optical resonators. These phenomena have profound implications for the development of precise optical clocks, high-capacity data transmission systems, and advanced laser sources. The driven-damped nature of the LLE introduces additional complexity by accounting for the continuous injection of energy into the system and its subsequent dissipation, making it a rich subject for both theoretical and experimental investigations.

Traditional methods of solving the LLE involve numerical techniques which can be computationally intensive and sensitive to initial conditions. Recently, the advent of machine learning and, more specifically, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) has provided a new paradigm for solving such differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of neural networks while embedding the physical laws governing the system into the learning process, thereby offering an efficient and potentially more accurate means of modeling complex dynamical systems like those described by the LLE.


## Modeling: A driven-damped NLSE -- Lugiato-Lefever Equation

The Lugiato-Lefever equation is a partial differential equation used in nonlinear optics to describe the field inside an optical cavity. It is given by:

$$
i\frac{\partial \psi(t, \theta)}{\partial t} = \delta_0 \psi(t, \theta) -  \frac{D_2}{2}\partial^2_\theta \psi(t, \theta) - \gamma|\psi(t, \theta)|^2 \psi(t,\theta)  + i\frac{\kappa}{2}\left(\psi(t, \theta)-H \right)
$$

where:

- $\psi(t, \theta)$ is the complex field envelope,
- $t$ is the slow time variable,
- $\theta$ is the spatial variable,
- $D_2$ is the group velocity dispersion coefficient (higher dispersions are omitted),
- $\kappa$ is the cavity loss rate,
- $\delta_0 = \omega_0 - \omega_p$ is the cavity detuning between laser and pump,
- $H$ is the driving field amplitude.

This equation is a variant of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) with additional terms to account for cavity effects and external driving. The forms of dispersion and nonlinearity should be revised per materials and other factors, and here we assume the higher-order dispersion is weak in a Kerr medium.

### Comprehensive Understanding of the LLE

The Lugiato-Lefever Equation can seem complex at first glance, so let's break it down with a few examples and intuitive explanations.

1. **Optical Frequency Combs:**
   Optical frequency combs are spectra consisting of a series of discrete, equally spaced elements. They are crucial for high-precision measurements and have applications in spectroscopy, telecommunications, and the development of optical clocks. The LLE helps in understanding how these combs can be generated within an optical cavity. When a continuous wave laser is coupled into a nonlinear optical resonator, the interaction between the dispersion and the Kerr nonlinearity (intensity-dependent refractive index) described by the LLE can lead to the formation of a stable frequency comb.

2. **Temporal Cavity Solitons:**
   Temporal cavity solitons are stable pulses of light that can circulate indefinitely within an optical cavity. These solitons are solutions to the LLE and are formed due to a balance between dispersion, nonlinearity, and the driven-damped nature of the system. Imagine a single pulse of light that maintains its shape and energy as it circulates inside the cavity, thanks to the precise balance of the LLE terms. These solitons can be used in optical communication systems to transmit information over long distances without distortion.

3. **Pattern Formation:**
   The LLE also explains how certain patterns of light can form in an optical cavity. These patterns result from the interplay between the nonlinearity and dispersion in the medium. For example, under certain conditions, the light field within the cavity can spontaneously break symmetry and form periodic patterns or localized structures. This phenomenon is similar to how ripples form on the surface of a pond when disturbed.

### Practical Example

Let's consider a simple analogy to understand the LLE. Imagine you're pushing a swing (the light field) in a playground. The swing has a natural frequency (resonance), and you push it at this frequency (driving force). If you push too hard (high driving amplitude), the swing will move erratically, but if you push just right, it will swing back and forth smoothly. Now, if the swing's chain is stretchy (nonlinearity), the swing's frequency will change depending on how high it goes. Additionally, if there's a little friction (loss), you need to keep pushing to maintain the swing's motion.
