# Self-Learning Diary

This repository was established to document my journey towards mastering computer science. With a background as a Ph.D. in theoretical and computational physics, I have garnered coding experience through MATLAB. My algorithmic expertise primarily revolves around resolving issues related to partial differential equations, encompassing stationary solutions, real-time dynamics, stability matrices, among others. Although these academic endeavors have necessitated data manipulation and visualization, they do not conform to industry standards.

As a recent graduate exploring opportunities across various companies, I recognize that deep domain knowledge is not a prerequisite. Consequently, I am convinced that showcasing a robust tech toolkit and a strategic approach to problem-solving are paramount.

For a considerable period, I grappled with devising an efficient strategy to transition into a role as a machine learning specialist. To navigate this, I have outlined a plan focusing on several key areas to not only secure a position but also ascertain the depth of knowledge required to excel.

It is imperative to note that the codes and explanations presented here may not be flawless. Despite this repository being public, I anticipate minimal exposure, primarily operating under the assumption that it will likely go unnoticed. Drawing from my academic experience, I deem it necessary to make this disclaimer.
