# Self-learning-Diary

## Purpose and background
This repo is created to record my self-learning path towards computer science. As a PhD in theoretical and computational physics, I will share some insights towards the algorithm from phsical intuition. Most importantly, I want to track my learning steps to a brand-new domain (I LOVE IT!)

I have to mention that the codes and explanations will not be perfect. I started to code in Python in the middle of 2023 and touch data structure/algorithm since Oct. 2023. I think nobody will watch this repo, even though it is a 'public' one. From the 'academic experience', I have to claim this.

For a new gamer in computer science, I believe algorithm is crucial and will change the coding habit and intuition. I won't treat myself as a strong programmer, but may be good at math and logic stuff. So the main target is to develop strong problem-solving strategy and around thirty percent focus on the tech part.
