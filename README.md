# Self-learning-Diary

## Purpose and background
This repo was created to record my self-learning path towards computer science. As a PhD in theoretical and computational physics, I will share some insights towards the algorithm from physical intuition. Most importantly, I want to track my learning steps to a brand-new domain (I LOVE IT!)

I have to mention that the codes and explanations will not be perfect. I assume nobody will watch this repo, even though it is a 'public' one. From the 'academic experience', I have to claim this.

For a new gamer in computer science, I believe the algorithm is crucial and will change the coding habit and intuition. I won't treat myself as a strong programmer but I may be good at math and logic. So the main target is to develop a strong problem-solving strategy and around thirty percent focus on the tech part.
