    "Notice, the brute-force algorithm has two loops, leading to O(n^2). To reduce the time complexity for huge input, we now introduce the merge-sort algorithm below. The idea is similar: taking the example from the handwritting above and we slightly change the array to [9, 2, 5, 3]. Now, they have inverses of (9, 2/3/5) and (5, 3). When it splits to the minimal elements, the first comparision during the recursive are the pairs (9, 2) and (5, 3), so the reverse count returns 2. Then, one layer above, the trees will be sorted pairs [2, 9] and [3, 5]. The 'while' loop compares: 2 vs. 3 (good, i+1=1, j=0); 9 vs. 3 (reversed, i=1, j+1=1, reverse_count+1); 9 vs. 5 (reversed, i=1, j+1=2, reverse_count+1)."

Below is a simplified explanation of how it's done. Following the above habit, I will use the brute-force first and then optimise it."
